Welcome to my personal page. I'm Chen Yuxuan, an undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.hku.hk/">The University of Hong Kong (HKU)</a> in the <a href="https://www.cs.hku.hk/">Department of Computer Science</a>. I was fortunate to be mentored by Prof. <a href="https://fangweizhong.xyz/">Fangwei Zhong</a> in the <a href="https://eng.bigai.ai/">Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI)</a> about simulating human behaviors and activities by Large Language Models (LLMs). Additionally,during exchange program at <a href="https://www.pku.edu.cn/"> Peking University (PKU)</a>, I also conducted a project on benchmarking for graph augmentation methods at <a href="https://cmlr.pku.edu.cn/"> Center for Machine Learning Research(CMLR)</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://zwt233.github.io/"> Wentao Zhang</a>.
Feel free to contact <a href="mailto:yxchen02@connect.hku.hk">me</a> :-)

Current research interests
===
- Equipping foundation models with advanced capabilities (including social interaction, planning)
- Enhancing models' abilities like reasoning and problem-solving through methods such as multi-agent systems and new computational approaches
- Applying power of AI in real-world scenarios

In the past, I also conducted some research on:
- Graph Machine Learning (augmentation methods)
- Machine Learning in Bioinformatics (infection classification)
- Large Language Model Agents (Desire-Driven Agent, D2A)
