About me
===
Welcome to my personal page. I'm Chen Yuxuan, an undergraduate student at the University of Hong Kong in the Department of Computer Science.

In my previous years of study, I have tried diverse aspects including machine learning in bioinformatics, graph machine learning, and also large language model agents. Feel free to contact me~

<!-- Outside the [computer room](https://i.cs.hku.hk/ccc2018/haking.html), I am interested in photography, which is surprisingly similar to debugging, except with more [funny comparison]. I also spend countless hours [another hobby], proving that my ability to lose track of time isn't limited to coding sessions. -->
