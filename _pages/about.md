Welcome to my personal page. I'm Chen Yuxuan, an undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.hku.hk/">The University of Hong Kong</a> in the <a href="https://www.cs.hku.hk/">Department of Computer Science</a>. I was fortunate to be advised under the mentorship of Prof. <a href="https://fangweizhong.xyz/">Fangwei Zhong</a> in <a href="https://eng.bigai.ai/">Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI)</a>

In my previous years of study, I have tried diverse aspects including machine learning in bioinformatics, graph machine learning, and also large language model agents. Feel free to contact me..
